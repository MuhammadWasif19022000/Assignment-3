(4)What is a difference between these operators “?? And?”  

ANS: Conditional Expressions 

Dart has two operators that let you evaluate expressions that might otherwise require ifelse statements  

 

condition ? expr1 : expr2 

If condition is true, then the expression evaluates expr1 (and returns its value); otherwise, it evaluates and returns the value of expr2. 

 

expr1 ?? expr2 

If expr1 is non-null, returns its value; otherwise, evaluates and returns the value of expr2 

Example: 

 

void main() {  

   var a = null;  

   var b = 12;  

   var res = a ?? b;  

   print(res);  

}
